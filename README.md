# FileExplorer
The "File Explorer Web Application" is a user-friendly and interactive tool designed to mimic the functionalities of a file system explorer. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this application provides users with an intuitive interface for managing folders and files in a hierarchical structure.
### Features:

1) User Interface: The application features a clean and modern user interface. Users are greeted with a prominent title and an input box where they can enter names for new files and folders.

2) Interactive Elements: The interface includes interactive buttons for creating new folders and files, as well as expanding and collapsing folders to view their contents. Each folder and file can be renamed or deleted with just a click.

3) Validation and Feedback: The application employs input validation to ensure that folder and file names adhere to specific criteria. If the provided name is not valid, users receive instant feedback and are guided on the correct format.

4) Dynamic Rendering: As files and folders are created or renamed, the application dynamically renders these changes in the user interface. This ensures that users always have an accurate representation of the file system's structure.

5) Hierarchy Management: Folders and files are organized hierarchically, allowing users to create sub-folders within folders. The application visually represents this hierarchy, making it easy for users to understand the relationships between items.

6) Efficient Operations: The application optimizes the user experience by allowing users to quickly create, rename, and delete files and folders. With intuitive icons and buttons, users can perform these operations seamlessly.
